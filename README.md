AR Art Rationale
This project rationale will be discussing the AR Art assignment and describing the process of making and designed the poster and the unity build model.
The marker poster for the assignment contains a QR code and instructions on what to do after scanning the QR code. The poster has a planet and a space rocket as a marker for Vuforia to display a 3D model of a space rocket blasting off. In unity after placing down the AR camera for Vuforia and an image target for the camera I imported the model that was made in 3DS max as the model that would be displayed when the image target has been activated using the apk. There’s also particle effect near the thrusters of the model to simulate the space rocket blasting off, there’s also a sound clip of rocket engines and animation of the model itself moving and loops when the apk is opened and the camera is pointed at the marker poster.
The assignment created some learning experiences when making the AR android app from unity. The unity project must be linked to an android SDK and Android studio must have several components installed for unity to build an apk of the unity Vuforia scene. Before building the project it must be augmented reality supported in the player settings.
